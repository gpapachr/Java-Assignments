# Java-Assignments

Here are my projects developed as assignments of AUEB's "Introduction to Java Programming" course. The description of each one is included as a pdf file but only in greek. Exersices are simple implementations of known methods like factorials or combinations just for better understanding of object-oriented programming. Projects are larger-scale implementations of completed applications without graphic elements.
