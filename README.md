# Java-Assignments

Here are my projects developed as assignments of AUEB's "Java Programming" course. The discription of each one is included as a pdf file but only in greek. Exersices are simple implementations of known methods as factorials or combinations just for better understanding of object-oriented programming. Projects are larger-scale implementations of completed application without graphics.
